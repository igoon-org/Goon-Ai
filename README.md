# Goon AI Project by iGoon

## Overview
The **Goon AI** project is an innovative initiative focused on leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to enhance user experiences in various domains such as gaming, content generation, and predictive analytics. 

The project is currently in its early development stages and aims to build robust AI-driven applications that integrate seamlessly with iGoon's technological ecosystem.

## Development
The Goon AI project is currently in its early development stage. Our current focus includes:

- **Building the core architecture** for the AI system, ensuring scalability and modularity.
- **Setting up the environment** and preparing data pipelines for AI training.
- **Designing a frontend interface** that will allow users to interact with the AI models.
- **Researching datasets** for training purposes and ensuring a sustainable data-driven development approach.

## AI Training
Training for Goon AI is still in the preparation phase. We are working on the following:

- **Dataset Collection**: Curating diverse and high-quality datasets for training models in areas such as NLP, computer vision, and predictive analytics.
- **Model Selection**: Identifying the most suitable machine learning algorithms and architectures, such as neural networks, transformers, and reinforcement learning models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Setting up robust metrics to evaluate model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

Once we finalize the dataset and training scripts, weâ€™ll begin the actual AI training process.

## Future Goals

- **AI Training**: Start the model training phase and iterate on improving the AI's accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.
- **Goon AI Game Integration**: Integrate Goon AI into the iGoon 2D parkour game as an intelligent NPC or difficulty adjustment tool.
- **Launch Beta**: Release an early-access beta of Goon AI tools for developers and the public to test and provide feedback.
- **Create AI-Powered Applications**: Build applications powered by Goon AI, such as content generation tools, interactive chatbots, or AI-powered design assistants.
